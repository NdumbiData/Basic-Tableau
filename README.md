# Basic Tableau
 My name is Ndumbi Kimani, a data scientist, and this Tableau Public dashboard is part of my ongoing work for Superstore. This project is focused on optimizing operational efficiency and providing actionable insights through advanced data analysis. The goal is to enhance decision-making by leveraging data-driven insights.  The project workflow includes key steps like data cleaning to ensure accuracy, in-depth analysis to uncover trends, and data visualization through Tableau Public. Tableauâ€™s interactive and dynamic features allow users to explore the data in a more intuitive and insightful manner.  You can view the full Tableau Public dashboard here: Tableau Public Dashboard.  Additionally, you can explore this and other projects on my GitHub repository, where I regularly share data analysis tools and insights.
